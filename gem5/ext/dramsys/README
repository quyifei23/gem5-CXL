Follow these steps to build DRAMSys as part of gem5

1. Go to ext/dramsys (this directory)
2. Clone DRAMSys: 'git clone https://github.com/tukl-msd/DRAMSys --branch v5.0 --depth 1 DRAMSys'

The latest verified working version is v5.0, but later versions might work too.
gem5 will automatically pick up DRAMSys as an external module when it is rebuilt.

If you wish to run a simulation using the gem5 processor cores, make sure to enable the storage mode in DRAMSys.
This is done by setting the value of the "StoreMode" key to "Store" in the base configuration file.
Those configuration file can be found in 'DRAMSys/library/resources/configs/simulator'.

Currently, DRAMSys is only supported in conjunction with a cache. Running DRAMSys in Release mode without caches will silently fail!

Note: DRAMSys requires cmake version >= 3.24. This is not available via apt on Ubuntu 20.04 or 22.04. 
See `util/dockerfiles/ubuntu-20.04_all-dependencies/Dockerfile` for an example of how to install cmake 3.24.
