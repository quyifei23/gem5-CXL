/*
*
* Models num_ALUs pipelined atomic ALUs with a depth of access_latency ticks.
* Rather than reserving ALUs, this class assumes multiple requests can go
* through an ALU at the same time. As such, up to numALU new requests can
* go through at once, with the caveat that a line already being processed
* in an ALU can't start processing again until the previous request has exited
* the pipeline.
*
* ALUs aren't mapped directly to cache lines. Rather, ALUs are treated as
* a free list.
*
* Behavior:
*   Requests will go through unless one/both of the following are met:
*       - There have been more than [numALUs] requests in the current cycle
*       - The same line has been accessed in the past accessLatency ticks
