    # For the functions that return numerical values we use a vector of ints.
    # The order of the values is: EAX, EBX, EDX, ECX.
    #
    # If the CPU function can take an index, the index value is used as an
    # offset into the vector and four numerical values are added for each
    # possible index value. For example, if the function accepts 3 index
    # values, there are 12 total ints in the vector param. In addition, the
    # last values for functions which take an index must be all zeros. All
    # zeros indicates to the KVM cpu / OS that there are no more index values
    # to iterate over.
    #
    # A good resource for these values can be found here:
