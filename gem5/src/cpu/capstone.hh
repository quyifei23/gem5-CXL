 * Capstone Disassembler:

 * instruction might not coincide with the instruction being
 * decoded + executed in gem5. This could be the case if
 * there was a bug in either gem5 or in capstone itself.
 * This scenatio is not possible with the native gem5 disassembler
 * as the instruction mnemonic is tightly coupled with the
 * decoded(=generated) instruction (you print what you decode)
 *
 * The Capstone dispatches to the native disassembler in
 * two cases:
 *
 * a) m5 pseudo ops
 * b) micro-ops
