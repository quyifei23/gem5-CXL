# ASM Test

These tests run a set of RISCV binaries on a bare bones syscall execution.
In addition, these test run these binaries against different CPU types.
To run these tests by themselves, you can run the following command in the tests directory:

```bash
./main.py run gem5/asmtest --length=[length]
```
