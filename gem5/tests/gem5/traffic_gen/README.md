# Traffic Generator

This tests the gem5 memory components with a simple traffic generator.
It also checks the correctness of the statistics outputted by gem5.
To run these tests by themselves, you can run the following command in the tests directory:

```bash
./main.py run gem5/traffic_gen --length=[length]
```
