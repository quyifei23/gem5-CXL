# gem5 Library Example Tests

This set of tests checks the examples in `configs/example/gem5_library`, and makes sure they run to completion.
To run these tests by themselves, you can run the following command in the tests directory:

```bash
./main.py run gem5/gem5-resources --length=very-long
```
