"""
This allows us to generate stubs for the modules in gem5. The output will be
a "typings" directory which can be used by Pylance (Python IntelliSense) to
infer typings in Visual Studio Code.

Note: A "typings" directory in the root of the workspace is the default
location for Pylance to look for typings. This can be changed via
`python.analysis.stubPath` in "settings.json".

Usage
=====

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
scons build/ALL/gem5.opt -j$(nproc)
./build/ALL/gem5.opt util/gem5-stubgen.py
```
